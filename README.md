The dashboard allows users to filter through different neighborhoods in San Francisco. Once filtered, the dashboard will show you prices per square footage, avg. pricing of homes, and a map to allow a visual representation. This will help homeowners and buyers in these areas to be able to compare and contrast different neighborhoods and help them make a concise decision on pricing or buying the right home for you.
